# NodeJS library for the AJA KiPro series.

A simple library for the AJA KiPro series.

* You can currently:
* Set/Get settings
* Get playlists
* Get clips
* *Download media from KiPro*

I'm using it to pull media from the KiPro but you can use it for whatever you feel like.

Very nice
just go

**npm install kipro**

be happy
